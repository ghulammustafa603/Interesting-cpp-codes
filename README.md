# C++ Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that cover various programming concepts, including basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this repository is a great resource to practice and learn C++ programming.

## Contents:
- **Basic C++ Programs**: Simple programs demonstrating C++ syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Programs using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in C++.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and other common data structures in C++.
- **Algorithms**: Basic algorithms for sorting, searching, and recursion.
- **File Handling**: Programs demonstrating file reading and writing in C++.
- **Miscellaneous**: Other C++ programs that showcase various features of the language.

## Installation:

To run these C++ programs, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can install a C++ compiler like **G++** as part of the **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**.

Once the compiler is installed, clone or download this repository and start running the programs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghulammustafa603/CPP-Programs-Collection.git
```

## Usage:

1. Navigate to the program directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPP-Programs-Collection
   ```

2. Compile and run a C++ program:
   ```bash
   g++ <ProgramName>.cpp -o <ProgramName>
   ./<ProgramName>
   ```
